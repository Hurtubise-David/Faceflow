# Facemesh

Tensorflow Facemesh model is a lightweight machine learning pipeline predicting 486 3D facial landmarks to infer the approximate surface geometry of a human face ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.06724.pdf)).


More background information about the model, as well as its performance characteristics on different datasets, can be found here: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VFC_wIpw4O7xBOiTgUldl79d9LA-LsnA/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VFC_wIpw4O7xBOiTgUldl79d9LA-LsnA/view)


## Installation

You need to install yarn to build the app.

Install the app using the shell command FaceFlowApp.sh:

    $ cd D:/GitHub/FaceflowApp/Tensorflow/facemesh/demo (YourDir)
    $ yarn 
    $ yarn watch
